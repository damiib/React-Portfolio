            <p>
            Hello World! Thank you for visiting my site. My name is Atiyah. I am an artist who loves art and music. I am
      sharing my class work with you. I am so grateful to be learning coding I want to be successful at this and grow in
      this market.</p>

      <div>
      <p> This has not been an easy class for me. I am trying everyday to be better at in coding. I think it is important to
      understand the work that you are doing rather than how it looks. First, learn why you are using a certain if
      statment or function. If you do not understand the code, do not write it until you understand it. Once you understand the code,
      then you should focus on the design. I am being patient with myself because there is a lot of information to be
      have to absorbed. My work is not perfect, but it will eventually get better. I thank you for visiting my site and I
      am looking forward to everyone visting my site again.</p>
