        <p>Thank you for visiting my site. My name is Atiyah. I am an artist who love great art and music. I am
        sharing my class work with you. I am thrilled to be learning coding. I want to be successful at this and grow in
        this market.</p>

      <p>This has not been an easy class for me. I am trying everyday to be better at this. I think it is important to
        understand the work that you are doing rather than how it looks. First, learn why you are using a certain if
        statment or function. It does not make sense to write code and not undertand it. Once you understand the code,
        then you should focus on the design. I am being patient with myself because there is a lot of information that you
        have to absorb. My work is not perfect, but it will eventually get better. I thank you for visiting my site and I
        am looking forward to everyone visting my site again.
      </p>
